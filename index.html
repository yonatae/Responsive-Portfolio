                    Hello fellow space cadet! My name is Mae Richards, and I design and build websites. A student at UNC Bootcamp's Summer 2018 cohort, and a previous freelancer with some self-taught knowledge, coding has always been a hobby as much as a career. I am a lover of cats and a firm believer that it takes twenty breaks before something can be fixed. I also love art and painting (the header of the site is an example of such!)

                <p>
                    Jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand favor packaging over toy yet kitty scratches couch bad kitty mrow but bite the neighbor's bratty kid for lick the other cats. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms hack chew foot, so refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am so meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun.
                </p>
